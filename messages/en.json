          "answer": "Our mentors are current students from elite universities like the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University. We know what you're thinking—'Can students really help my child?' That's why we prioritize not only academic excellence but also their experience balancing sports and academics, and their genuine commitment to supporting students. Because they've walked the same path, they truly understand your child's struggles and can provide empathetic, proven guidance."
        },
        {
          "question": "What grade levels do you serve?",
          "answer": "We serve middle school students, high school students, and students preparing for university entrance exams. We carefully design personalized plans tailored to each student's target schools, current academic level, and athletic commitments. Whatever your child's situation, please feel free to reach out for a consultation."
        },
        {
          "question": "How detailed is the study plan?",
          "answer": "We create highly detailed plans with weekly schedules and daily to-do lists. During our weekly check-ins, we review progress and flexibly adjust the plan as needed. Of course, we also factor in practice schedules and competitions to ensure the plan is realistic and achievable for your child."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can everything be done online?",
          "answer": "Yes, all our support services are fully online. We use Zoom for consultations and a dedicated learning management app for progress tracking and Q&A. You can access our services anytime with an internet connection—even during away games or training camps. Rest assured, distance is never a barrier."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I receive one-on-one tutoring?",
          "answer": "Yes, absolutely. In addition to study planning support, we offer one-on-one tutoring as an optional add-on for subjects where your child needs extra help. We also offer tutoring-only plans. For detailed pricing information, please check our pricing page or feel free to contact us."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there material fees or enrollment fees?",
          "answer": "There are no enrollment fees whatsoever. For study materials, we recommend age-appropriate textbooks and workbooks available at retail stores, which you'll purchase separately. Your mentor will provide detailed guidance on which materials are best for your child's needs, so you can feel confident in your choices. For detailed pricing information, please see our pricing page."

          "question": "How does the contract work?",
          "answer": "Each family contracts directly with Nobilva on an individual basis. We do not contract directly with teams. This structure allows us to provide flexible, personalized support tailored to each athlete's unique situation and goals. For families joining through a team, we apply team special pricing to each individual contract.",
          "teamOnly": true
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there any burden on the team administration?",
          "answer": "There are no costs for the team administration. All we ask is an invitation to your team's communication channels (such as LINE groups) so we can reach out to athletes and families. After onboarding, we handle all operations directly with each family, so there's no ongoing administrative work required from your team. You can introduce our services with complete peace of mind.",

        {
          "question": "Do you provide reports to parents?",
          "answer": "Yes, we provide regular reports to parents upon request. We'll share detailed updates on academic progress, study habits, and how well your child is balancing sports and academics. The frequency and content of reports can be customized to your family's preferences, so please let us know what works best for you."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you help athletes who miss school frequently due to tournaments?",
          "answer": "Yes, absolutely—in fact, these are exactly the athletes who benefit most from Nobilva's support. For athletes who miss school frequently due to tournaments and competitions, or who struggle to balance sports and academics, we create realistic, flexible plans and maintain close communication. Many of our athletes have successfully built strong study habits despite demanding schedules."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does it take to see results?",
          "answer": "Results vary by individual, so we can't provide a specific timeline. However, our first priority is helping each student establish sustainable study habits, then building toward academic improvement and goal achievement (such as admission to target schools or earning recommendations). Your mentor will support your child every step of the way—no rushing, just steady progress."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you offer free trials or consultations?",
